# Fix Me a Drink

[Fix Me a Drink](https://tinyurl.com/fixmeadrink) is a website written in PHP and hosted using AWS EB that displays recipes of cocktails. Users can request recipes based on ingredient, cocktail name, or randomly. It uses [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) API, a database of crowd-sourced drinks and cocktails from around the world.

The reason behind making this website was to try out PHP and learn more about cocktails. Personally I'm more of a drink purist; I prefer my whisky/whiskey neat, but I can appreciate a good cocktail. With this website I've learned a lot about PHP, templating, and I've encountered some seriously strange cocktail recipes. One of the recipes even contains a recipe on how to cook ribs!
